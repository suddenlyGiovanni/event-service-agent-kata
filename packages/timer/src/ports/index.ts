/**
 * Timer Module Ports
 *
 * Port interfaces that the Timer module depends on, following hexagonal
 * architecture principles (dependency inversion).
 *
 * Ports defined here:
 * - ClockPort: Time operations (current time)
 * - TimerPersistencePort: Timer storage operations
 *
 * Ports reused from contracts:
 * - EventBusPort: Message publishing/subscribing
 *
 * Usage in Timer module:
 * - Command handlers depend on these ports
 * - Polling worker depends on these ports
 * - Adapters implement these interfaces (in-memory, SQLite, etc.)
