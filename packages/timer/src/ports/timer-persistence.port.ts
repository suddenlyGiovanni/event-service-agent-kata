/**
 * TimerPersistencePort - Timer storage abstraction
 *
 * Provides persistence operations for TimerEntry entities. The adapter handles
 * all storage-specific details (SQL queries, connection pooling, transactions).
 *
 * Used by: Timer module (command handlers, polling worker)
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Storage-agnostic: works with SQLite, PostgreSQL, or in-memory
 * - Effect-based: all operations return Effect for composability
 * - Idempotent: safe to call operations multiple times
 * - Query optimization: findDue() should be fast (indexed on dueAt, status)
 *
 * Based on {@link ../../../../docs/design/modules/timer.md timer} and {@link ../../../../docs/decisions/ADR-0003-timer.md ADR-0003}

/**
 * TimerPersistencePort - Timer storage port interface
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Store and retrieve TimerEntry entities
 * - Query for due timers efficiently
 * - Update timer status atomically
 * - Handle errors generically (adapter logs details)
 *
 * Adapter responsibilities (hidden from domain):
 * - SQL query construction and optimization
 * - Index management (dueAt, status, composite key)
 * - Connection pooling and transaction management
 * - Constraint enforcement (unique tenantId+serviceCallId)
 * - Schema migrations
 * - Encoding/decoding between domain types and storage format
 *
 * Storage key: (tenantId, serviceCallId) - ensures idempotency
 *
 * @example handleScheduleTimer
 * ```typescript
 * const handleScheduleTimer: Effect.Effect<void, PersistenceError, TimerPersistencePort> = pipe(
 *    TimerPersistencePort,
 *    Effect.flatMap(persistence => persistence.save(TimerEntry.make(command, now))),
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * @example  Polling worker: find and process due timers
 * ```typescript
 * // Polling worker: find and process due timers
 * const pollForDueTimers: Effect.Effect<
 * 	void,
 * 	PersistenceError | PublishError,
 * 	TimerPersistencePort | EventBusPort | ClockPort

 * 		// this should be done in a done as a single transaction
 * 		Effect.andThen(
 * 			// Publish DueTimeReached event
 * 			eventBus.publish(),
 * 			// Mark as fired
 * 			() => persistence.markFired(timer.tenantId, timer.serviceCallId, now),
 * 		),
