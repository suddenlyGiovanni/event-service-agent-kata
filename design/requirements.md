# Requirements

## User Story
**As a user,**
- I need a multi-tenancy agent executing service calls in a unified way supporting at least one message protocol (e.g. HTTP).
- I need a user interface allowing me to trigger immediate and defined scheduled calls including execution status.
- I want to be able to filter already created service calls and tag the important ones to find them more easily.

## Base Assumptions 
- free choice of technologies and frameworks for the implementation
- Outgoing requests are mocked to be able to test the service agent offline
- Existing (web-)services can be used to demo real requests
