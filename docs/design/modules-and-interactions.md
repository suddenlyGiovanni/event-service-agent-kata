# Modules & Interactions (within the Service Agent BC)

Scope

- This document describes modules inside a single bounded context: the Service Agent (Service Call Management). These are technical/organizational modules around one domain model and ubiquitous language.

Overview

- [Edge/API] (Delivery): Validates HTTP, publishes commands, queries DB for UI.
- [Orchestration] (Core, single writer): Owns `ServiceCall` lifecycle, invariants, and DB writes.
- [Execution] (Supporting): Performs HTTP call, emits outcome process events.
- [Timer] (Infrastructure): Schedules and emits [DueTimeReached] as process events.

```

- API: validation, idempotency surface, HTTP mapping, read DB for UI
- Orchestration: invariants, policy, single-writer DB transitions, outbox
- Execution: HTTP call, emit process events
- Timer: due handling, emit process events

Message Index

- Orchestration (commands in, domain events out):
  - Commands in: [SubmitServiceCall], [DueTimeReached], [ExecutionStarted] OR [ExecutionSucceeded] OR [ExecutionFailed]
  - Commands out: [StartExecution], [ScheduleTimer]
  - Domain events out: [ServiceCallSubmitted], [ServiceCallScheduled], [ServiceCallRunning], [ServiceCallSucceeded], [ServiceCallFailed]
- Execution:
  - Commands in: [StartExecution]
  - Events out: [ExecutionStarted], [ExecutionSucceeded], [ExecutionFailed]
- Timer:
  - Commands in: [ScheduleTimer]
  - Events out: [DueTimeReached]
- API (Edge):
  - Commands out: [SubmitServiceCall]

EDA without ES/CQRS (MVP)

- DB is source of truth; Orchestration is the only writer.
- Broker transports commands/events; API reads DB directly (no projections).
- Outbox ensures domain events are published after commit.
