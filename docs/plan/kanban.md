# Kanban

<!--
Purpose:
    A tiny, self-managed Kanban:
    edit by moving items between sections.
    Keep it short.
-->

WIP limits: Doing ≤ 2. Keep Ready small (≤ 7).

## Inbox

<!--
Raw ideas/tasks.
    Triage here, then move to Ready.
    Use IDs like PL-#.
    Keep this short.
-->

- (PL-13) Choose broker adapter details for dev/prod parity [adr: [ADR-0002]]
- (PL-20) Confirm monolith boundaries (API inside vs separate; Execution worker split) [adr: [ADR-0001]]
- (PL-9) Observability baseline [adr: [ADR-0009]] [infra] — blocked by [adr: [ADR-0002]]

## Ready

<!--
Prioritized queue.
    Pull the top item into Doing. Avoid more than 7 items.
    Link ADRs like [adr: ADR-0001]; add tags like [infra] or [Api].
-->

- (PL-4) Timer module with in-memory scheduler [Timer]
- (PL-2) Orchestration core domain model and transitions [Orchestration]
- (PL-3) Broker adapter implementation + local broker setup [infra]
- (PL-5) Execution module with mock HttpClientPort [Execution]
- (PL-6) Persistence adapter (SQLite) and migrations [infra]
- (PL-7) API server with submit/list/detail routes [Api]
- (PL-8) Redaction & idempotency utilities + tests [contracts]
- (PL-20) Confirm monolith boundaries (API inside vs separate; Execution worker split) [adr: [ADR-0001]]

## Doing (WIP ≤ 2)

<!-- Only what you're actively working on. Move one item at a time. -->

<!-- Move the top Ready item here when you start it. Keep ≤ 2. -->

## Blocked

<!-- Item is waiting on something (decision, dependency). Note the blocker briefly. -->

- (PL-9) Observability baseline [adr: [ADR-0009]] [infra] — blocked by [adr: [ADR-0002]]

## Done (recent)

- (PL-1) Scaffold `contracts` package with message and port types [contracts] — PR #17 merged: 5 branded types, 3 commands, 9 events, MessageEnvelope
- (PL-22) Migrate from Node.js + pnpm to Bun runtime [infra] — Runtime migration complete
- (PL-12) Database structure decision (shared vs separate files) — Accepted [adr: [ADR-0004]]
- (PL-19) Timer delegation strategy (custom vs broker delay) — Accepted [adr: [ADR-0003]]
- (PL-21) Correct NATS delay capability evaluation in ADR-0002 — PR merged

<!-- Keep last few wins visible. Archive older items by copying them to an Archive section/file if desired. -->

## Notes (today)

- Focus: PL-1 ✅ COMPLETE — Contracts package scaffolded with branded types, command/event messages, and MessageEnvelope. PR #17 ready to merge (all Copilot feedback addressed).
- Next: PL-4 — Timer module with in-memory scheduler (reprioritized per user preference). Will implement delay scheduling and DueTimeReached event emission per [ADR-0003].
- Note: PR #17 review comments are all addressed; waiting for merge before starting PL-4.

<!-- 2-3 bullets max. What you focus on, current risks, next up. -->
